   - WhatsApp interface for receiving recommendations and interacting with the system

2. **Backend Services**:
   - API Gateway/Backend for orchestration and business logic
   - Recommendation Engine powered by LlamaIndex/RAG (Handles matching for all user criteria, including location, duration, budget, food, activities, and included accommodation/transportation preferences)
   - Accommodation Engine leveraging LLM with internet search (Secondary engine for finding alternative/external accommodation or details when not covered adequately in tour packages)
   - WhatsApp Integration Service for messaging
   - Vector Data Processing Pipeline for transforming raw tour data and user preferences into vector embeddings for semantic matching

3. **Data Stores**:
   - Supabase Database (PostgreSQL with vector capabilities)

4. **External Systems**:

  - Multi-dimensional preference matching (location, budget, activities, etc.)
  - Ranking algorithm for recommendation relevance

#### 3.2.2.1 Recommendation Ranking Algorithm

The engine employs a weighted scoring algorithm based on semantic vector similarity to rank tour packages against user preferences across multiple criteria.

**Ranking Criteria & Normalized Weights:**

User preferences are matched against tour package attributes using the following normalized weights (adjusted to sum to 100%):

*   **Locations:** 45.5% (Matches `user_interest` location against `package.location_vector`)
*   **Duration:** 18.2% (Matches `user_interest` duration against `package.duration_vector`)
*   **Budget:** 9.1% (Matches `user_interest` budget against `package.budget_vector` or derived from `package.price`)
*   **Transportation:** 9.1% (Matches `user_interest` transport preference against `package.transportation_vector`)
*   **Food:** 4.5% (Matches `user_interest` food preference against `package.food_vector`)
*   **Activities:** 4.5% (Matches `user_interest` activity preference against `package.activities_vector`)
*   **Accommodation & Notes:** 9.0% (Matches combined `user_interest` accommodation needs and notes against `package.notes_vector`)

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Gather & Vectorize User Preferences:** Collect user input for all criteria and convert each preference aspect into a vector representation using the same embedding model as the package vectors (e.g., `User_Location_Vector`, `User_Duration_Vector`, etc.).
2.  **Fetch Candidate Packages:** Retrieve relevant `travel_packages` from Supabase, potentially pre-filtering by the primary location.
3.  **Calculate Similarity Scores:** For each candidate package, calculate the normalized cosine similarity (scaled to 0-1) between the corresponding user preference vector and package vector for each of the 7 criteria groups.
4.  **Calculate Final Weighted Score:** Compute the total score for each package by summing the products of each normalized similarity score and its respective normalized weight.
    `Total Score = (NormSim_Location * 0.455) + (NormSim_Duration * 0.182) + ... + (NormSim_Accommodation_Notes * 0.090)`
5.  **Rank Packages:** Sort packages in descending order based on `Total Score`.
6.  **Return Top Results:** Select the top N (e.g., 10) packages.

**Note on Merged Accommodation:** This algorithm integrates accommodation preferences directly into the main tour package ranking, assuming package details (especially within `notes_vector`) are sufficient for comparison. The separate "Accommodation Engine (LLM + Search)" may now be considered a secondary feature for finding alternative accommodations or when package details are insufficient, rather than the primary mechanism. The architecture description may need refinement to reflect this merged approach.

#### 3.2.3 Accommodation Engine (LLM + Search) - Secondary Role
- **Functionality**: Provides a secondary mechanism to find external accommodation options using LLM and internet search. Triggered when a user explicitly requests alternatives, or if a selected tour package lacks sufficient detail on included lodging.
- **Key Features**:

        string logo_url
        string description
        string website
        timestamp created_at
    }
```

**Key Vector Functionality:**

The system utilizes OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model which produces 1536-dimensional vectors for all embeddings. These vectors are stored in the database tables using the pgvector extension, which enables efficient similarity search operations.

Vector search is implemented through a specialized RPC function called `search_travel_packages` that performs a weighted ranking of travel packages based on similarity across multiple attribute dimensions:

- Location similarity (45.5% weight)
- Duration similarity (18.2% weight)
- Budget similarity (9.1% weight)
- Transportation similarity (9.1% weight)
- Food similarity (4.5% weight)
- Activities similarity (4.5% weight)
- Accommodation & Notes similarity (9.0% weight)

The search function uses cosine similarity (represented by the `<=>` operator in pgvector) and calculates a weighted sum of similarities across all dimensions to produce a final ranking score. The database is optimized with IVFFLAT indices on key vector fields to enable fast similarity search even with large datasets.
