# Travel Buddy System - Technical Architecture Documentation

## 1. Executive Summary

The Travel Buddy system is an AI-powered travel recommendation platform designed to simplify tour discovery, booking, and accommodation finding for both foreign and Vietnamese tourists. The architecture leverages modern technologies including LlamaIndex for AI-powered recommendations, NextJS for the frontend, and Supabase for data storage, with WhatsApp as the primary interaction channel.

This solution addresses key pain points in the travel industry through:
- Personalized tour recommendations based on user preferences and locations of interest
- Seamless WhatsApp integration for convenient access and notifications
- Simplified tour booking process with clear payment pathways
- AI-driven nearby accommodation recommendations
- Vector search capabilities for semantic matching of user preferences with tour packages

The architecture prioritizes scalability, security, and user experience while providing a modular foundation that can evolve with changing business requirements.

## 2. System Overview

The Travel Buddy architecture follows a microservices approach with clearly defined components handling specific responsibilities. The system is designed to be cloud-native, scalable, and secure.

### 2.1 High-Level Architecture

The system consists of four major component groups:

1. **User Interfaces**:
   - NextJS web application for user registration and preference input
   - WhatsApp interface for receiving recommendations and interacting with the system

2. **Backend Services**:
   - API Gateway/Backend for orchestration and business logic
   - Recommendation Engine powered by LlamaIndex/RAG (Handles matching for all user criteria, including location, duration, budget, food, activities, and included accommodation/transportation preferences)
   - Accommodation Engine leveraging LLM with internet search (Secondary engine for finding alternative/external accommodation or details when not covered adequately in tour packages)
   - WhatsApp Integration Service for messaging

3. **Data Stores**:
   - Supabase Database (PostgreSQL with vector capabilities)

4. **External Systems**:
   - Facebook Authentication
   - Tour Payment Gateway
   - WhatsApp Business API
   - LLM Provider API
   - Internet Search API
   - Tour Provider Data Sources

The system boundaries are clearly defined, with internal components handling core functionality (user profiles, preferences, recommendations) while external systems manage authentication, messaging, and payment processing.

## 3. Architecture Components

### 3.1 User Interfaces

#### 3.1.1 NextJS Web Application
- **Functionality**: Provides responsive web interface for users to register, login, and set preferences
- **Key Features**:
  - Facebook authentication integration
  - Multi-step preference capture interface (locations, budget, food, transportation, activities)
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop users
  - Progressive web app capabilities for improved mobile experience

#### 3.1.2 WhatsApp Interface
- **Functionality**: Enables users to receive recommendations and interact with the system
- **Key Features**:
  - Rich message formatting for tour recommendations
  - Interactive buttons for quick responses
  - Media sharing for tour images
  - Natural language understanding for user queries

### 3.2 Backend Services

#### 3.2.1 API Gateway / Backend (Python)
- **Functionality**: Central orchestration point for all services
- **Key Responsibilities**:
  - Authentication and authorization management
  - User profile and preferences handling
  - Service coordination
  - Request validation and error handling
  - Rate limiting and traffic management

#### 3.2.2 Recommendation Engine (LlamaIndex/RAG)
- **Functionality**: Core intelligent component for generating personalized recommendations
- **Key Features**:
  - Vector embedding and indexing of tour packages
  - Semantic search capabilities using LlamaIndex
  - Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhanced recommendations
  - Multi-dimensional preference matching (location, budget, activities, etc.)
  - Ranking algorithm for recommendation relevance

#### 3.2.2.1 Recommendation Ranking Algorithm

The engine employs a weighted scoring algorithm based on semantic vector similarity to rank tour packages against user preferences across multiple criteria.

**Ranking Criteria & Normalized Weights:**

User preferences are matched against tour package attributes using the following normalized weights (adjusted to sum to 100%):

*   **Locations:** 45.5% (Matches `user_interest` location against `package.location_vector`)
*   **Duration:** 18.2% (Matches `user_interest` duration against `package.duration_vector`)
*   **Budget:** 9.1% (Matches `user_interest` budget against `package.budget_vector` or derived from `package.price`)
*   **Transportation:** 9.1% (Matches `user_interest` transport preference against `package.transportation_vector`)
*   **Food:** 4.5% (Matches `user_interest` food preference against `package.food_vector`)
*   **Activities:** 4.5% (Matches `user_interest` activity preference against `package.activities_vector`)
*   **Accommodation & Notes:** 9.0% (Matches combined `user_interest` accommodation needs and notes against `package.notes_vector`)

**Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Gather & Vectorize User Preferences:** Collect user input for all criteria and convert each preference aspect into a vector representation using the same embedding model as the package vectors (e.g., `User_Location_Vector`, `User_Duration_Vector`, etc.).
2.  **Fetch Candidate Packages:** Retrieve relevant `travel_packages` from Supabase, potentially pre-filtering by the primary location.
3.  **Calculate Similarity Scores:** For each candidate package, calculate the normalized cosine similarity (scaled to 0-1) between the corresponding user preference vector and package vector for each of the 7 criteria groups.
4.  **Calculate Final Weighted Score:** Compute the total score for each package by summing the products of each normalized similarity score and its respective normalized weight.
    `Total Score = (NormSim_Location * 0.455) + (NormSim_Duration * 0.182) + ... + (NormSim_Accommodation_Notes * 0.090)`
5.  **Rank Packages:** Sort packages in descending order based on `Total Score`.
6.  **Return Top Results:** Select the top N (e.g., 10) packages.

**Note on Merged Accommodation:** This algorithm integrates accommodation preferences directly into the main tour package ranking, assuming package details (especially within `notes_vector`) are sufficient for comparison. The separate "Accommodation Engine (LLM + Search)" may now be considered a secondary feature for finding alternative accommodations or when package details are insufficient, rather than the primary mechanism. The architecture description may need refinement to reflect this merged approach.

#### 3.2.3 Accommodation Engine (LLM + Search) - Secondary Role
- **Functionality**: Provides a secondary mechanism to find external accommodation options using LLM and internet search. Triggered when a user explicitly requests alternatives, or if a selected tour package lacks sufficient detail on included lodging.
- **Key Features**:
    - LLM-powered search query generation based on tour location and specific user requests (e.g., "find hotels near X", "hostels with pools").

- **Key Features**:
  - Message formatting and templating
  - Webhook handling for incoming messages
  - Session state management
  - Media handling for tour images
  - Conversation flow management

### 3.3 Data Stores

- **Functionality**: Primary data repository for all application data
- **Key Features**:
  - PostgreSQL with pgvector extension for vector operations
  - Relational schema for users, locations, providers, and tour packages
  - Vector embeddings storage for semantic search
